## 10 commandments for the confident tech manager, by example:

### foundation, serverless, markup, eschew programing
Student HW: Create S3 account and install FTP
- Markdown vs markup via Pug (your second hire)
- Scripted build in js vs GULP
- Serverless FTP Deploy to S3, CDN77
- SSR ex: Stripe + Zeit now, Node, Docker
- Website -> webapp = binding
- Static binding /blog page
- Webmaster by google, (demo AMP via pug after 6/1), SEO
-  (  Serverless Auth with FireBase secure some pages for members only - after 6/1 )
- Dynamic binding with pug, w/ FireBase call
- ( Reporint (datatables w/ firestore  after 6/1)
- CSS customization

### b&m and embrace UX focus:
- Use a plugin
- dynamic binding with riot
- App shell / PWA
- Scroll UX, sticky & 'on viewport' / infiniscroll
- Vanila TS router SPA and events
- Good FW and bad FW/ Riot binding, local
- Router page transition FX example
- Swipe/touch Gesture of FX example
- SPA to App store via phone gap. ( aka Mobile first )
-  ( * Ecom, after 6/1 Stripe checkout )
- run meta as daemon
- Web IDE, 3rd party on S3 vs FTP
- Hosted dev enviroment. Build server, release engineer

### prespective, meta and cost cutting
(  Co hosting

)

## '10' conclusion, the secret List for managers:

0. 1 GL < 2 GL < 3 GL < LAMP
1. Doing a day study/experiment is OK - of UX (scooter, bike, car)
2. serverless, less staff/ less stuff / less $
3. embrace cloud build server / admin with resources
4. PWA/SPA = native mobile via cross platorm > SEO
5. Deploy very often
6. Engaged UX! FX ! Gestures!
7. Cloud IDE make it accessible. Anyone that knows HTML can edit. And secure.
8. Hourly consulting vs fixed bid. If you book hours, you get hours.
9. List of usefull api. Log. Alogolia. FireStore. FireAuth. Stripe.
10. like PHP philosophy, avoid (js) programing, avoid programers that program
11. You content creator? That is your developer
12. Rapid prototyep

Other:
Brading, we got 4: nbake.org, metabake.org, wordpug, narwhall.
That is confusing.
Our main value I think is meta. We should have on brand till we get to 100 develoopers. What?
