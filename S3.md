# S3

There are a few guide on the web on deploying/hosting a static website on S3.
You should try  those.


First time you setup to host a website on S3 takes about an hour. After you do a few, it is
10 minutes.

Steps at high level
- Create S3 bucket
- Ex policy, replace 'exapp' with your bucket name in here:

		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
						"Sid": "AddPerm",
						"Effect": "Allow",
						"Principal": "*",
						"Action": "s3:GetObject",
						"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::exapp/*"
				}
			]
		}

- Go to IAM to create a user of S3
- Certate a key and secret code. Store this information.
- In IAM create a group 'full access to s3'
- FTP a simple website.
- Configure the http cache - using an S3 Gui
- Go back to S3 menu. In properties, make it a website. It gives you an url. Your CDN should point to this, and your DNS should point to your CDN.

In the end, the question is, does CyberDuck (FTP) work?

Try to FTP and to
and to access an S3 hosted website.
