# S3


First time you setup to host a website on S3 takes about an hour. After you do a few, it is
10 minutes.


- Create S3 Bucker:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html

- Add Bucket Policy in Permissions

		{
			"Version":"2012-10-17",
			"Statement":[{
				"Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
					"Effect":"Allow",
				"Principal": "*",
					"Action":["s3:GetObject"],
					"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
					 ]
				}]
		}

- Upload a simple index.html using console:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/upload-objects.html#upload-objects-by-file-selection

- On the Properties Tab of your bucket, ensure that you have "Static Website Hosting" enabled (and index.html as index document). Note: this dialog will give you the url!!.

- Test the website.

- Your CDN should point to this, and your DNS should point to your CDN ( Ex: KeyCDN and EasyDNS )


## Enable 'FTP' ( and File System Access) :
- Go to AWS IAM to create a user of S3
- Create a key and secret code. Store this information.
- In IAM create a group 'full access to s3'
- FTP a simple website.

In the end, the question is, does CyberDuck (FTP) work? CyberDuck and other GUI toools have S3 support.

One that works, then we can assume our Admin tools will work with the file system.

Now you can FTP the real site using GUI.
( also a remote File System, what we use in the admin moudle)

## Configure the http expiration headers
